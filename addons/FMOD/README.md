# FMOD for Godot

[![Build](https://github.com/alessandrofama/fmod-for-godot/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alessandrofama/fmod-for-godot/actions/workflows/build_all.yml) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1083520667451920394?label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/XQbvRdQcNn)

Welcome! This repository provides an integration of [FMOD Studio's audio middleware](https://www.fmod.com/) into the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org). At the moment, **FMOD version 2.02.17** and **Godot 4.1.1 stable** are supported.

## Features

* Use the FMOD Studio API on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android) with a [GDExtension library](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.html) that seamlessly integrates with Godot and GDScript.
* Modify and build the library for any target platform with ease using SCons, a flexible and cross-platform software construction tool.
* Streamlined audio authoring workflow with FMOD Studio Live Update, which lets you sync your audio project with your game in the editor or in a build. Experiment and iterate faster without reloading or recompiling your game.
* Custom blocking I/O implementation that uses Godot's `FileAccess` API. This ensures compatibility across different platforms.
* Custom FMOD nodes, such as StudioEventEmitter3D, StudioEventEmitter2D, StudioBankLoader, StudioListener3D, StudioListener2D, StudioParameterTrigger and StudioGlobalParameterTrigger. Create an immersive audio experience for players with little code.
* Event **Timeline Marker** and **Timeline Beat** callback support to easily synchronize your game with your audio's logic. You can use these callbacks to trigger animations or gameplay events based on the timing of your audio events.
* Generate unique identifiers (GUIDs) for GDScript to maintain organization and consistency in your project. GUIDs will help you reference FMOD assets without hard-coding paths or names. 
* Search and preview Events in the Godot editor with the **FMOD Project Browser**. This handy tool lets you browse through all the Events in your project and play them back directly in the editor.
* Customize **FMOD settings** for each platform in the Godot Project Settings. You can adjust settings such as **sample rate**, **speaker mode**, **real and virtual channels**, **DSP buffer size** and more to optimize performance and quality for each platform.
* Studio API wrapper unit tests ensuring a reliable and stable integration.
* Custom performance monitors to track the performance of FMOD in the editor.
